### Introduction

Welcome to the advanced semantic segmentation metrics project! It is an open-source tool that evaluates a variety of metrics (including miou, fiou, dice, accu, precision, recall) for semantic segmentation. The code also supports multi-scale evaluation and crf post-processing. All contributions are welcome!
